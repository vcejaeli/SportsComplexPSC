This is a website for a fictitious gym/sports complex facility where people can sign up for memberships. 
The website has a landing, membership, available, amenities, about, contact, and account page. 
The idea is to get members and be able to track them on the website. 
The facility offers many things so there is a toggle to check when an area/amenity is in use.
